# JavaScript API for [Coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coverage_data) objects

This is based on [CoverageJSON](https://github.com/neothemachine/coveragejson) but abstracts over it to make it exchangeable. It's purpose is to serve as a common interface that libraries can implement and depend on.

Start here: [`Coverage` objects](Coverage.md)
